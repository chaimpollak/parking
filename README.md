parking
=======

This program was created to demonstrate what to do when arriving to a full

parking lot with no extra parking space. There are 2 options that you can do,

either to sit idle and wait until someone will leave, or to drive around impatiently,

waiting for someone to leave. 

This program uses the monte carlo method to simulate an approximation of the time 

being wasted by either driver and plots them on a graph.

I have included the graph in this repository as parking1000.png
